      'something already stated in the conversation. Ask a question only for essential information that is genuinely ' +

  // ── SHELLY AQUARIUM-LIGHT BRIDGE ────────────────────────────────────────
  //  Builds a plan of favourable ON hours for a house's aquarium and deposits
  //  it into the xkdg-shelly Worker (?set_plan&device=..). Plug = LIGHT only.
  //
  //  RULES (Edu, session 22 — these REPLACE every earlier aquarium rule):
  //   • ON at the START of the day's BEST hour (highest Tier; ties by XKDG then Qimen).
  //   • Window = 2nd-half-of-Zi (solar 00:00) .. end of SHEN (solar 17:00).
  //   • LATE hour (Xu/Hai): taken ONLY if its block runs past 23:00 of the same day
  //     — i.e. only if the extension below actually fires. Otherwise fall back to the
  //     day's best IN-WINDOW hour, accepting a lower Tier. No in-window hour -> the day
  //     stays dark (one hour of light before the 23:00 off is worth nothing).
  //   • EXTENSION: a Tier 4 day stays on until 23:00 of D+2, unless D+1 is Tier 3 or
  //     better (a strong day is never swallowed). A Tier 3 day stays on until 23:00 of
  //     D+1, unless D+1 is Tier 2 or better. Tier 2 and Tier 1 always switch off at
  //     23:00 of their own day.
  //   • NOTHING IS EVER ASKED. Only the final Procedi/Annulla before committing.
  //  Times use the HOUSE's True Solar Time; the OFF is 23:00 on the CIVIL clock.
